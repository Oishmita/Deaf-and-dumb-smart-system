# Deaf-and-dumb-smart-system
A smart system for the deaf and dumb people to communicate, using Arduino ATMEGA328, Buzzer, push buttons and LCD screen 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This is a circuit which will help the deaf and dumb people to interact or specify their needs to the nurse or the helping hands. 
If this system is installed in hospitals, then the needy would be able to specify their needs by just pressing the following switches. Their requirement will then be displayed on the LCD screen, present in the common room of the nurses or other such. With this a buzzer will be activated and will not stop until the nurse resets the system with the reset button.
In this prototype we have used four main buttons of requirement and one reset button. Each button specifies a particular requirement which is written below it. When the user demands a particular thing out of the four then he/she just have to press the respective button. With the press of the button a buzzer in the nurses’s room will be activated and the requirement will be displayed on the lcd screen provided along with the buzzer. These two will remain activated until the nurse or caretaker  response by pressing the reset button. With this the nurse will be able to fulfil the requirement of the needy as soon as possible. 
This prototype is designed for a single patient or person. This can be further modified by installing it for several other beds or rooms in the hospitals. 



Components Used:

1.	Arduino uno
2.	Lcd screen
3.	Buzzer
4.	I2C module
5.	Push buttons
6.	Resistance (10k)
7.	Wires 



Future Modification:

If we use a NRF module then we can control the above system wirelessly where a text message will be sent to the caretaker or master’s device even when the above people are unavailable in the lcd display room. A single nrf module can also be used to control six beds at a time.
